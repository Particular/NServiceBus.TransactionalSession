# NServiceBus.TransactionalSession

This package enables usage of transactional message sessions with NServiceBus outside of a message handler.

It is part of the [Particular Service Platform](https://particular.net/service-platform), which includes [NServiceBus](https://particular.net/nservicebus) and tools to build, monitor, and debug distributed systems.

See the [Transactional session documentation](https://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/transactional-session/) for more details on how to use it.
